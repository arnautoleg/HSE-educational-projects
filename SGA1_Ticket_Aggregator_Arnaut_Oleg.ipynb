    "2. Analyze the aggregator based on the information from the brief. Describe its advantages and disadvantages. Do you personally find these criteria and this classification rule convincing? Use words, not a code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregator as disadvantage has low differentiation in \"others\" category. For example, if we have a price = 100, transfer number = 1 and luggage or refund are not included this ticket is in the same category as a ticket with 250 dolars price, 3 transfers and no both luggage and refund. For \"the best\" tickets were applied strong condition, next, \"good enouth\" has more liberal condition (did not take in account the luggage and refund). As advantage it descirbe very good \"the best\" offer and takes in account the most important caracteristic as price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there is no options to take in account the personal preferences or particularities (health, do you travel with family or alone). As example, low price, 1 transfer for a person with newborn is not the best, the choise being more expensive but with no transfers ticket. Or, in case of large family is important to save money and they prefered the chipest tickets and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no range among included components. In my opinion, the main points for ticket are the price, transfers and duration (this criteria was not used for actual classification), because, finally, is important how much time you loss for travelling, the luggage toghether with the refund beeing lees important.\n",
    "\n",
    "As conclusion, to optimize the aggregator we have to classify the gap among the first ans second category, to introduce the duration and we have to be more flexible in relation to refund and luggage (if a ticket has good price we can cover the laggege with no problems) in all possible categories. It coud be more \"effective\" to propose the optimal ticket at the moment, conclusion beeing \"at this moment according to your option the optimal ticket is this one\", with no categories, but we can use it in condition if we have to select the optimal ticket having a couple of them."

    "3. Suggest your alternative solution. Propose other criteria, completely different way of categorizing offers, \n",
    "different categories themselves - whatever you think should enhance the aggregator based on the brief. \n",
    "You are supposed, first, describe it in words, and, second, show your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second question the principles of individual approach was formulated. In addition to existing criteria \n",
    "the duration fly in hours wil be add. Also, need_luggage toghether with need_refund will be added. We will try to categorise the offers in 4 categories depends on users preferences calculating an integrative score. Important to mention that each parameter will have his own weight. Maximal weigth has the price, followed by duration, transfer number having the same power as luggage and refund because of assotiation with duration. Thus, transfers number, having relative decresed weigth only corrects the duration scores value. The scores range (3-6, 7-12, 13-18 and more than 18) is not random. I have tried to modelae different situation. In the same time I can say that this approach, probably, is not ideal and can be completed by another parameters.\n",
